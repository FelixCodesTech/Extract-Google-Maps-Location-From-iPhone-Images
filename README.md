# Extract-Google-Maps-Location-From-iPhone-Images
A working python script where you just fill in a folder location and it will automatically give you all Google Maps locations from all images. (Though they do have to also contain the right EXIF data for that...)

Any files where it finds EXIF data (if it doesn't, you'll have to manually add a location name), will be added to the list, which is copied to your clipboard. The list contains a count, the image names and the Google Maps location.
